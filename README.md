# Muff Mode

Muff Mode is a server-side mod for Quake II Remaster which enhances or provides variety to the overall player experience with a heavy focus on developing the multiplayer. Pulling some inspiration (and code!) from Quake III Arena and Quake Live, it polishes and refines how multiplayer matches are handled and the tools for managing them. Muff Mode also introduces a number of familiar gameplay modifications and match features that will cater for both casual and competitive players alike.
